# Code Book

This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in `tidy_dataser.txt`.

# Modifications

## the original data was modifies by

* Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Useing descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Identifiers

* `subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

## Measurements

## Activity Labels

* `WALKING` (value `1`): subject was walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value `2`): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value `3`): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` (value `4`): subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING` (value `5`): subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING` (value `6`): subject was laying down during the test
